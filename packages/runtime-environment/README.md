# Runtime Environment

## Overview

The Runtime Environment component provides a flexible, extensible abstraction for executing and managing development environments across different runtime strategies.

## Purpose

Create a unified interface for running development environments that can seamlessly switch between different execution strategies, such as WebContainers and Docker containers.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Runtime Strategy Management

- Provide a consistent interface for different runtime environments
- Enable dynamic runtime strategy selection
- Support pluggable runtime implementations

### 2. Environment Lifecycle Management

- Boot runtime environments
- Mount project files
- Execute commands
- Manage process lifecycle
- Handle environment-specific events

### 3. Execution Abstraction

- Abstract away differences between WebContainer and Docker runtime
- Provide a uniform method for:
  - Starting development servers
  - Running package managers
  - Executing shell commands
  - Capturing process output

## Key Interfaces

### RuntimeStrategy

```typescript
interface RuntimeStrategy {
  // Initialize the runtime environment
  boot(): Promise<void>;

  // Mount project files to the runtime
  mount(files: FileSystemTree): Promise<void>;

  // Execute a command in the runtime
  spawn(command: string, args: string[]): Promise<ProcessHandle>;

  // Listen to runtime events
  on(event: string, callback: Function): void;

  // Cleanup and tear down the runtime
  destroy(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Supported Runtime Types

- WebContainer
- Docker Container
- (Future) Local Machine
- (Future) Remote SSH

## Configuration

### Runtime Configuration

```typescript
interface RuntimeConfig {
  type: "webcontainer" | "docker";
  image?: string;
  ports?: number[];
  environment?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

## Event Model

- `server-ready`: Triggered when a development server starts
- `process-exit`: Notifies about process termination
- `error`: Captures runtime errors

## Security Considerations

- Sandboxed execution
- Resource limitation
- Secure file mounting
- Minimal privilege execution

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy initialization
- Caching of runtime environments
- Efficient file synchronization
- Minimal overhead runtime switching

## Error Handling

- Graceful degradation
- Runtime fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Automatic recovery strategies

## Future Extensibility

- Support for additional runtime strategies
- Enhanced resource management
- Advanced process monitoring
- Cross-runtime compatibility layers

## Usage Example

```typescript
const runtimeManager = new RuntimeManager();

// Dynamic runtime selection
const runtime = await runtimeManager.selectRuntime("docker", {
  image: "node:18",
  ports: [3000]
});

await runtime.boot();
await runtime.mount(projectFiles);
await runtime.spawn("npm", ["run", "dev"]);
```

## Integration Points

- Preview System
- File System Manager
- Actions Manager
- Error Resolution System

## Monitoring and Telemetry

- Runtime performance metrics
- Resource utilization tracking
- Execution time measurement
- Error rate monitoring

## Open Source Considerations

- Modular design
- Well-documented interfaces
- Minimal external dependencies
- TypeScript-first implementation
