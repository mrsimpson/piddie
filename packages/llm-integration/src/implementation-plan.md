# LLM Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the LLM Integration package, which serves as the core orchestrator for LLM interactions in the web-based code editor.

## Core Components

### 1. Types (`types.ts`)

We'll be using the OpenAI llm interaction definition all along (from the `openai` npm package).
Lateron, we might use other LLMs, but the LiteLLM proxy will adapt them to the OpenAI format.
Therefore, we don't need any adapters for particular LLM providers.

Define the core types for LLM integration:
- Message interfaces for LLM interactions. We shall consume the chat management types and internally map them
- Content block interfaces (text, image, tool use)
- Request and response interfaces
- Provider configuration interfaces
- Stream handling interfaces

### 2. OpenAI LLM client

Implement the necessary interfaces to send messages and receive (streamed) responses.

### 3. Orchestrator (`orchestrator.ts`)

The central component that:
- Enhances requests with context and tools
- Processes response streams
- Implements MCP host functionality

### 4. Main Entry Point (`index.ts`)

Exports the public API:
- `createLlmAdapter` function
- Types and interfaces

## Integration with Other Components

### Context Management

The LLM Integration package will interact with the Context Management package through MCP:
- Request context for enhancing LLM requests
- Pass context to LLM providers

### Actions Management

The LLM Integration package will interact with the Actions Management package through MCP:
- Request available tools
- Pass tool definitions to LLM providers
- Forward tool use requests to the Actions Manager
